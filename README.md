----------------------------------------
##_NOTE_

you will need to create a "bin" directory at the root and add your own copies of "autorunsc.exe" and "winpmem.exe".
----------------------------------------

1. Launch an ADMINISTRATOR command prompt from within the "incident-response" folder
2. Run the "!-- RUN ME FROM an ADMIN PROMPT (NOT as Admin) --!.bat" file

_IMPORTANT_ :: Launch a CMD prompt (as administrator) as oppossed to right-clicking .bat file and "Run As Administrator"; there is an issue with this regarding how permissions are handed out/off.

3. Verify files made it to the .\Incoming\ folder
4. Take back to analyst for analysis
